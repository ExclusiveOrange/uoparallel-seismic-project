If you try to use 'mpirun' on your local machine while connected to a VPN,
even if you're not using the VPN, you're gonna have a bad time.

MPI_Init seems to try to connect through the VPN, even if you didn't tell it to,
and of course it will fail, but it isn't smart so it just sits there doing nothing.

Easy fix: disable the VPN while using 'mpirun'.
